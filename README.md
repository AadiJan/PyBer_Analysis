# **PyBer_Analysis**
## ***Project-Overview:*** 
The intent of this project was to analyze the ride-sharing data by various city types. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, the data from different sources were further analyzed to understand the total weekly fares of each city type. The findings from this project will be presented to the executives at the PyBer corporation. 

## ***Project-Results:***
After performing the analysis from the given data, following results were observed. 
* Data source: 'city_data.csv' and 'ride_data.csv'
* Software: Jupyter Notebook 
* Data output can be found here [Pyber_Analysis](https://github.com/AadiJan/PyBer_Analysis)
* Snapshot of the ride-sharing data 

![Chart](https://github.com/AadiJan/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

As illustrated by the above chart, the total fares for the Urban cities are significantly higher that Suburban and Rural cities. One of the things to be noted here is that, there is an increase of the fares around the 3rd week of February followed by a downward trend on the 1st week of March. It is also evident that the total rides for the Urban cities are 10 times more than the Rural cities. With the higher volumes of the rides in Urban cities, the average fare per driver can be maintained at a lowest level of $16.57. This may be the reason for the average fare per ride for the Urban cities to be around 35% less than the Rural cities. 

## ***Summary:***
The following recommendations are to considered, 
* Consider re-routing/merge some of the Suburban rides to the Rural cities. 
* The number of rides should be increased in the  Rural cities to keep the average fare per ride low. 
* The number of drivers in the Urban cities can be further reduced to maximize the profit.
